The mosaic brain tissue in individuals harboring these variants allows for the study the cell type involvement and cell type-specific effects of pathogenic variants on transcription. To leverage mosaic brain tissue to understand how somatic variants contribute to disease, we developed Somatic Mosaic single-cell RNAseq (SoMoSeq), for genotyping pathogenic variant loci and sequencing full-length cDNA in single nuclei isolated from human brain tissue. SoMoSeq is a modified version of G&amp;amp;Tseq which uses biotinylated-oligodT-conjugated streptavidin coupled magnetic beads to physically separate DNA and RNA. The resulting DNA is amplified and genotyped with TaqMan assay, while the RNA is utilized to generate full length cDNA using SMARTseq2.We evaluated the efficacy of our approach using mosaic brain tissue samples harboring known pathogenic somatic variants: PIK3CA (E545K, VAF=28%) and SLC35A2 (Y145X, VAF=10%) and three age matched autopsy/stroke controls. After nuclei isolation and fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting with neuronal marker (NeuN), we used SoMoSeq to genotype and generate cDNA from 3072 nuclei. Genotyping analysis accurately reflected the variant allele frequencies (VAF) observed in bulk nuclei in neuronal(NeuN+) and non-neuronal(NeuN-) cells. In parallel, we generated high-quality cDNA from single nuclei (average yield of 1ng/L). From the NeuN+ and NeuN- populations, we selected 96 cells positive/negative for the variants (N=384/sample) and sequenced them at a depth of 8-10M reads/cell. Approximately 10,000 genes/nucleus were detected with an average mitochondrial read percentage of 3%, indicating the high quality of the data. We also observed significant upregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway in the PIK3CA sample compared to controls and evidence of the enrichment of mutations in NeuN- cell types in the mosaic SLC35A2 brain tissue. These findings align with those reported in literature and further validate the accuracy and significance of our method for investigating the effects of pathogenic somatic mutations on cell type-specific transcriptional profiles. Data integration of full length RNAseq with publicly available datasets from human cortex allowing for the classification of specific cell types harboring variant alleles are ongoing. SoMoSeq is a powerful approach that allows for precise identification of specific cell types harboring somatic variants and the ability to study cell type-specific autonomous and non-cell autonomous transcriptional effects of the variant in human brain tissue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Determining Single-cell Transcriptomic Signatures in Mosaic Epileptogenic Human Brain Tissue</title><link>https://brain-discourse.github.io/poster/aes-2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brain-discourse.github.io/poster/aes-2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>Abstract:
Rationale: Somatic variants acquired post-zygotically during embryonic cortical development are known to contribute to epilepsy-associated cortical brain malformations. The mosaic brain tissue surgically resected from affected individuals offers a unique opportunity to determine the burden of mutation across cell types, as well as the transcriptional effects of the mutation in specific cell types. However, simultaneous assessments of DNA and RNA from single cells required to harness this potential remain technically challenging. Here we describe a novel method that uses parallel single-cell genotyping and comprehensive transcriptomic profiling to study the cellular heterogeneity in mosaic epileptogenic brain tissue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods: Adapted from the G&amp;amp;Tseq protocol,1 we developed and optimized a method to simultaneously isolate DNA and RNA from single cells to identify the transcriptomic signature in single nuclei with and without the mutation (Figure 1). We benchmarked the protocol by comparing nuclei isolated from surgically resected brain tissue of a patient with hemimegalencephaly harboring a pathogenic somatic variant in PIK3CA (E545K) to an age-matched control sample. A fluorescently-labeled antibody against NeuN was used to isolate neuronal nuclei from the tissue specimens using fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting. Bulk (n=20,000 nuclei/total nuclei) and single nuclei (n=44 NeuN+ nuclei/sample) were collected for the case and control sample. RNA and DNA were isolated from single nuclei and bulk nuclei preparations. RNAseq was performed at a sequencing depth of 15 million (mil) reads/sample for NeuN- and NeuN+ bulk nuclei collections and for the 88 NeuN+ single nuclei from the case and control samples. Genotyping of amplified DNA was used to identify the mutation-positive cells using droplet digital PCR and a custom-designed TaqMan genotyping assay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Results: We saw a variant allele fraction of 30% (NeuN+) and 35% (NeuN-) in bulk nuclei collections from the mosaic PIK3CA brain tissue sample, which correlated with that seen in single nuclei. RNA from bulk nuclei populations consistently yielded ~10 mil uniquely mapped reads (UMR). We observed a transcriptomic signature consistent with an upregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway in both NeuN- and NeuN+ bulk nuclei in cases compared to controls. In addition, we found a transcriptomic signature associated with PIK3CA variants specific to NeuN+ nuclei in the CREB phosphorylation pathway. On average, we obtained ~5 mil UMRs per nuclei (80,000-13 mil, with &amp;gt;50% of cells achieving &amp;gt; than 5 mil UMRs per cell). Analysis of genotype-informed single nuclei RNAseq is ongoing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conclusions: This optimized approach for simultaneous single-cell genotyping and comprehensive cDNA sequencing will be a valuable tool for identifying cell type specific transcriptional profiles associated with recently identified epilepsy-associated mosaic mutations in human brain tissue and may guide us to novel therapeutic targets for treating intractable seizures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leveraging Mosaic Epileptogenic Human Brain Tissue to Study Cell-type Specific Transcriptional Changes Associated with a Pathogenic PIK3CA Variant</title><link>https://brain-discourse.github.io/poster/ashg-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brain-discourse.github.io/poster/ashg-2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>Abstract: Post-zygotically acquired mutations that arise during embryonic cortical development can lead to abnormal neuron morphology and/or migration defects, both of which can often result in seizures and developmental disabilities. Somatic mutations that cause abnormal activation of proteins in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway have been implicated in focal cortical dysplasia type 2 and hemimegalencephaly (HMEG). Surgically resected mosaic brain tissue from affected individuals offers a
unique opportunity to determine the burden of mutations and transcriptional effects of the mutations across cell types. To tease apart the transcriptional effects of the mutation within cell types, we modified the G&amp;amp;Tseq protocol to simultaneously perform single-cell genotyping and transcriptomic profiling to identify the comprehensive transcriptomic signature of mutation-positive and mutation-negative nuclei.
We benchmarked the protocol by comparing nuclei isolated from surgically resected brain tissue of a patient with HMEG harboring a pathogenic somatic variant in PIK3CA (E545K) to an age-matched control. We used a fluorescently labeled NeuN antibody to sort neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei for bulk
(n=20,000 nuclei/total nuclei) and single-cell (n=44 NeuN+ nuclei/sample) preparations. RNA extracted from bulk (NeuN+ and NeuN-) and single NeuN+ nuclei for both cases and controls was sequenced at a depth of 15 million (MM) reads/sample. In parallel, DNA was genotyped in mutation-positive bulk and
single nuclei using droplet digital PCR and TaqMan genotyping assay, respectively. A variant allele fraction of 30% (NeuN+) and 35% (NeuN-) was observed in bulk samples from the mosaic PIK3CA tissue, which correlated with that observed in single nuclei. RNA from bulk nuclei populations consistently yielded ~10 MM uniquely mapped reads (UMR) while RNA from single nuclei
yielded ~5-10 MM UMR. Transcriptomic analysis of bulk nuclei (NeuN- &amp;amp; NeuN+) and single nuclei (NeuN+) confirmed the activation of the mTOR pathway. We also observed transcriptomic signature associated with PIK3CA variants specific to NeuN+ bulk and single nuclei; namely, the CREB phosphorylation pathway and an upregulation of SPDYE5, a gene implicated in low-grade glioma.
Analyses of genotype-informed single nuclei RNAseq are currently underway. This approach will allow for novel insights into the impact of pathogenic somatic mutations on cell-autonomous and non-cellautonomous functions, high-resolution assessments of cell-type-specific mutation burden, and may help identify antiseizure targets for treating mTOR related intractable seizures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Somatic variants in diverse genes leads to a spectrum of focal cortical malformations</title><link>https://brain-discourse.github.io/publication/brain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brain-discourse.github.io/publication/brain/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Somatic variants in focal cortical malformations</title><link>https://brain-discourse.github.io/project/somatic-variant-analysis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brain-discourse.github.io/project/somatic-variant-analysis/</guid><description>&lt;p>Post-zygotically acquired genetic variants, or somatic variants, that arise during cortical development have emerged as important causes of focal epilepsies, particularly those due to malformations of cortical development. Pathogenic somatic variants have been identified in many genes within the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-signalling pathway in individuals with hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia (type II), and more recently in SLC35A2 in individuals with focal cortical dysplasia (type I) or non-dysplastic epileptic cortex. Given the expanding role of somatic variants across different brain malformations, we sought to delineate the landscape of somatic variants in a large cohort of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery with hemimegalencephaly or focal cortical dysplasia. We evaluated samples from 123 children with hemimegalencephaly (n = 16), focal cortical dysplasia type I and related phenotypes (n = 48), focal cortical dysplasia type II (n = 44), or focal cortical dysplasia type III (n = 15). We performed high-depth exome sequencing in brain tissue-derived DNA from each case and identified somatic single nucleotide, indel and large copy number variants. In 75% of individuals with hemimegalencephaly and 29% with focal cortical dysplasia type II, we identified pathogenic variants in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway genes. Four of 48 cases with focal cortical dysplasia type I (8%) had a likely pathogenic variant in SLC35A2. While no other gene had multiple disease-causing somatic variants across the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort, four individuals in this group had a single pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variant in CASK, KRAS, NF1 and NIPBL, genes previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. No rare pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variants in any neurological disease genes like those identified in the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort were found in 63 neurologically normal controls (P = 0.017), suggesting a role for these novel variants. We also identified a somatic loss-of-function variant in the known epilepsy gene, PCDH19, present in a small number of alleles in the dysplastic tissue from a female patient with focal cortical dysplasia IIIa with hippocampal sclerosis. In contrast to focal cortical dysplasia type II, neither focal cortical dysplasia type I nor III had somatic variants in genes that converge on a unifying biological pathway, suggesting greater genetic heterogeneity compared to type II. Importantly, we demonstrate that focal cortical dysplasia types I, II and III are associated with somatic gene variants across a broad range of genes, many associated with epilepsy in clinical syndromes caused by germline variants, as well as including some not previously associated with radiographically evident cortical brain malformations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sex-specific neurotoxic effects of heavy metal pollutants:Epidemiological, experimental evidence and candidate mechanisms</title><link>https://brain-discourse.github.io/publication/ehs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brain-discourse.github.io/publication/ehs/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hello R Markdown</title><link>https://brain-discourse.github.io/post/2020-12-01-r-rmarkdown/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 21:13:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://brain-discourse.github.io/post/2020-12-01-r-rmarkdown/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="r-markdown">R Markdown&lt;/h1>

Do we as individuals reserve a right to develop and maintain self-destructive habits? Public health in today’s world is a double-edged sword, stakeholders may not always benefit but others may see a new ray of hope. A review of worker rights within the US illustrates the economic quasi-coercion [1] associated with capitalism while the tobacco industry gives us a glimpse of the omnipresent psychological manipulation people were regularly subjected to. These two issues illustrate the restrictions on an individual’s ability to choose freely and the application of paternalism through public health interventions (OSHA regulations and tobacco tax) to successfully tackle situations when that individual is unable to make an informed decision to avoid harm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The industrialization and urbanization that followed the turn of the 20th century fuelled a precipitous rise in the number of factory jobs [2]. Yet job safety and worker welfare were of little concern in an era when profit was king. Worker safety was the responsibility of the workers themselves, as demonstrated by the Lochner vs New York, 1905 [3] case, which favored the liberty of contract over the health of bakers laboring in unhealthy conditions. Corporations were virtually insulated from liability due to occupational hazards because sustained low-level exposures were easily deniable. They took too long to manifest and not many diseases could be linked to a person’s occupation due to lack of immediate evidence. Silicosis was often mistaken for tuberculosis and only after the Hawk’s Nest Tunnel Disaster[3] was silica exposure recognized as an occupational hazard. Due to the massive press coverage of the incident, factories releasing silica dust, for the first time worked towards reducing exposure levels. There was, however, no legal or regulatory authority to enforce corrective action and assess risk. The environmental movement and the civil rights movement in the 1960s created a climate of reform paving a way for the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970, during the Nixon era [3]. Under this act, employers were responsible for ensuring the safety of their employees and work safety laws were passed and enforced [3].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Against this societal backdrop of gradually increasing attention to safety and health, advertising campaigns of the tobacco industry ensured a steady rise in cigarette consumption through psychological manipulation. Advertisers in the early 1900s bypassed consumers capacity to reason by active manipulation, rendering them confined to choose smartly. Marketing campaigns like “Reach for the Lucky instead of the Sweet” or “Doctors smoke Camels” walked the fine line so characteristic of the consumer culture between demanding conformity and asserting individuality [4]. This drastic rise in cigarette consumption was followed by an attendant rise in the incidence of lung cancers. Increasing interest in the relationship between smoking and lung carcinoma spurred the cigarette industry to launch a massive disinformation campaign by casting doubts on the science. Only after the release of the Surgeon General’s Report- “Smoking and Health” [5] in 1964 did the government decide to ban TV advertising of cigarettes and jumpstart the Non- Smoker’s Rights Movement [5]. The association between both, the industrial accidents and the rise in lung cancer incidents was the lack of causal relationship between exposure and the outcome, laying emphasis on the need for a precautionary approach [6].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R.E Goodin states, “Harm is of such a nature that it could be avoided by affected if they so choose. The incurring of the harm requires the active cooperation of the victim” [7]. One can say that smokers bring harm to themselves by rationalizing their addiction, anchoring fallacy and time discounting [7] because of voluntary decisions made in the early years influenced by one’s culture, peer pressure, and perpetually rampant manipulation by the media. At the same time, an employee’s decision to take a certain level of risk in exchange for money and job security is his own choice, but is such a decision true consent? R.E. Goodin [7]sheds some light on this topic by stating that smokers are usually not giving their rightful consent when they develop the habit of smoking. He says people can be held to have consented only if they knew to what they were supposedly consenting. This habit is usually picked up during the teenage years when people are minors and, thus, ineligible to give their consent. The addictive nature of nicotine ensures that smoking will soon spiral into addiction. Addiction is the absence of free will [8] and, therefore, taking an addict’s consent would be tantamount to a first order violation. Similarly, a person agreeing to a hazardous job to not stay unemployed is also not giving rightful consent. These examples illustrate the concept of quasi- coercion [1], in which consent dictated by unfair restriction of alternatives is an indirect, pervasive erosion of choice. The quasi-coercive nature of smoking and unsafe employment are fundamentally due to social institutions. In this unfair market, the inequality between certain sections of the society grows over time, leaving them with no bargaining power, making risk taking a mandatory job requirement. Quasi- coercion, thus, creates only an illusion of autonomy [1].
Differential risk of disease in different socioeconomic classes is also evident. The impact of widespread anti-smoking campaigns is clear among the educated and wealthy. However, the people with lower socioeconomic status due to lack awareness on health concerns of cigarettes and occupational stress, resort to smoking as a coping mechanism. As a result, they become victims of the regressive cigarette tax and denormalization of smoking and are subject to increasing marginalization and stigmatization. This demographic is also more susceptible to economic quasi-coercion. Daniel M Gade [9] very effectively highlights this issue by asking what would happen if every individual had a chance to start equal? Inequalities in health status are not solely the consequences of inequality in health services, but also a result of lifestyle choices one makes due to inequity. This emphasizes the need for equitable redistribution of social goods since having equality in health care does not compensate us for the unequal risks of getting ill. Guaranteeing equal opportunity necessitates the elimination of differential risk, the prevention of excess illness, and the alteration of fundamental institutional arrangements [1].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ensuring equal opportunity would require the elimination of harmful choices. Does the government have the right of stopping people who want to live and act in a way they falsely believe to be safe? Is it the responsibility of public health workers to ensure that consent to smoke or take up risk is rightfully taken and by no means coerced on an individual? The ultimate justification for paternalism must be utilitarian, ensuring that overall social utility is maximized when utilities of all members of the society are maximized [7]. Decisions regarded as self-destructive and unhealthy are not conclusive grounds for interventions. Only if these decisions are a result of independently defined failures of competency such as addiction or low socio-economic status is paternalistic intervention justified. Yet unhealthy lifestyles impose a substantial burden on an uninvolved portion of society that, nevertheless, must share the costs of illnesses created by said choices. In response to this, we follow John Stuart Mills’s Harm principle [10] and work our way towards Neoprohibitionism [8] by changing norms (ban on smoking in public places) and making each pack of cigarettes reflect the price of the negative externalities (cigarette tax).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In argument, one may bring up the issue of autonomy and individual liberty of smokers and workers, which conflicts with public health interventions. There exists a conflict between liberty and equality, such that unduly paternalistic and stringent regulations prize workers’ health more highly than the workers themselves[1]. Several professions such as that of a soldier, stuntman, and firefighter involve risks, yet are regularly portrayed as heroic; why should exposure risk be classified differently. Doesn’t this overreaching by the meddlesome nanny state agency (OSHA) violate the concept of autonomy? A smoker’s opinion is lost in the tyranny of the majority. The rights of the individual are subsumed within the social contract [7] which permits government intervention in situations in which individual competence to make rational decisions is temporarily or permanently undermined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the lessons of history, while, it may take a tragedy to realize the importance of safety and health regulations, one can successfully counter such issues with appropriate measures and support from the industry and the government in the form of OSHA compliance and introduction of cigarette taxes. A paternalistic approach may seem slightly overbearing, but it is necessary to ensure social equity and protect the vulnerable from exploitation. Although autonomy or personal freedom is central to human rights [11], this autonomy can at times be illusionary with regard to “valid consent”. Successful public health interventions in the field of occupational health and tobacco industry demonstrate that “harm” despite being instilled upon oneself as a “choice” is nothing but an illusion of autonomy, differentially distributed in our society. It is, therefore, the duty of public health professionals to ameliorate injustice and establish trust in people by providing them with adequate information, thereby, allowing them to make informed decisions. After all, an intervention is only effective when there is a significant amount of public trust involved in adapting it.&lt;/p>

annual increase in drug-related deaths ever recorded by the CDC in history. New York City
lost 1,374 people, with Staten Island being the epicenter of the overdose epidemic where 101
residents succumbed to drug overdoses, mostly involving opioids in 2017
alone. Infamously called painkiller paradise, this borough, a 30-minute ferry ride away from
Manhattan is replete with blue OxyContin pills and adorned with used heroin needles. This
is a public health crisis transcending age, race, and income.  
What started out as a war on drugs during the Nixon era to stigmatize the people of color
became a national epidemic, yet our response has long been rooted in racism and
elitism. With whites being called victims and blacks referred to as addicts, we see a huge
divide based on America’s social hierarchies. It is not as if the addicts have made a choice to
succumb to drugs at the cost of their job, their family or loved ones but are simply the victims
of quasi - coercion due to the addictive nature of the problem. We have little compunction in
saying that the addict&amp;rsquo;s free will is sufficiently impaired, that his apparent consent counts for
naught, emphasizing the need to tackle this problem more like a medical challenge than
criminal justice by embracing compassion and evidence-based interventions,
especially among the marginalized.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The prevalent definition of addiction–a destructive and compulsive behavioral trait marked
by moral failure needs to be supplanted by the one which describes it as a physical
dependence, something which can be treated as a medical condition. Medication-assisted
treatments (MAT), mostly using Methadone and Suboxone to aid addicts with symptoms of
withdrawal like nausea, body ache, anxiety, excessive sweating, and hallucinations are a need
of the hour. Supplemented with psychotherapy and clean supply of prescription heroin it
can successfully bring down the dependency of people on opioids by addressing behavioral
issues, supporting recovery and preventing relapse. With Methadone and Suboxone being
opioids themselves, this intervention fulfills the opioid craving and stops the cycle; however,
it is not meant to be used as a replacement but to bring drug-use to a safer habit with a
consistent dosage pattern. This strategy is both effective and significantly cheaper than
adding inpatient beds at rehabilitation centers. However, only about one-third of addiction
programs in America offer this treatment, with women, Blacks and Hispanics being less
likely to receive it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the New York City health department has implemented various interventions to
address the medical, psychological and socio-cultural aspects of the epidemic
such as MAT, increased insurance coverage, psychotherapy, good Samaritan laws, and
substance use counseling, they have failed to reach the marginalized sections of the society.
Despite the Healing NYC plan proposed last year to bring down opioid-related deaths to less
than 35%, the epidemic continues to break up families and is one of the leading causes of
higher crime rates and deaths, predominantly in Staten Island and South Bronx, the two
boroughs with many marginalized communities. With overdoses increasing to
112% among black New Yorkers, it is agonizing for people of color to see no commensurate
regard for vulnerable communities who continue to be criminalized and written off, demanding a bipartisan response. It means replacing addiction with physical dependence,
reducing the stigma surrounding the issue and encouraging doctors to provide medication for
addiction in a primary care setting. To make these drugs more accessible to
the marginalized, effort should be made to reduce the high copayments for these drugs and
reach out to communities where issues like these are more prevalent instead of just branding
them as addicts.
  
  These interventions don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be exempt from the argument that some patients will
continue to misuse opioids and spiral down to abuse. However, the model has been
successfully implemented in places like Sydney, Lisbon, and Vancouver, and
has strategically brought down overdose rates. Portugal single-handedly transitioned from the
“heroin capital” of the world to a country with the lowest drug-related death rate in Western
Europe in the past decade by adopting the harm reduction approach. Portugal’s story
reiterates the need for working towards addiction and addiction therapy as a medical
condition, not a moral failure and making maintenance drugs almost as accessible as other
forms of medication. Effort should be made to decriminalize drug use, eliminate the stigma
and reluctance in seeking help, especially among the marginalized. While we can’t
completely eradicate opioids, it is possible to save numerous lives if we treat them as sick
humans who need helping hands, not handcuffs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://brain-discourse.github.io/admin/config.yml</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brain-discourse.github.io/admin/config.yml</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
