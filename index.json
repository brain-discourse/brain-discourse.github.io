To identify early molecular changes in nerves that may drive sarcopenia initiation, we performed a longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of the sciatic nerve, which governs lower limb muscles, in aging mice. Methods- Sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle were obtained from female C57BL/6JN mice aged 5, 18, 21 and 24 months old (n = 6 per age group). Sciatic nerve RNA was extracted and underwent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Functional enrichment analysis of clusters of genes associated with patterns of gene expression across age groups (adjusted P-value \u003c 0.05, likelihood ratio test [LRT]) was performed. Pathological skeletal muscle aging was confirmed between 21 and 24 months by a combination of molecular and pathological biomarkers. Myofiber denervation was confirmed with qRT-PCR of Chrnd, Chrng, Myog, Runx1 and Gadd45ɑ in gastrocnemius muscle. Changes in muscle mass, cross-sectional myofiber size and percentage of fibres with centralized nuclei were analysed in a separate cohort of mice from the same colony (n = 4-6 per age group).Results- We detected 51 significant DEGs in sciatic nerve of 18-month-old mice compared with 5-month-old mice (absolute value of fold change \u003e 2; false discovery rate [FDR] \u003c 0.05). Up-regulated DEGs included Dbp (log2 fold change [LFC] = 2.63, FDR \u003c 0.001) and Lmod2 (LFC = 7.52, FDR = 0.001). Down-regulated DEGs included Cdh6 (LFC = -21.38, FDR \u003c 0.001) and Gbp1 (LFC = -21.78, FDR \u003c 0.001). We validated RNA-seq findings with qRT-PCR of various up- and down-regulated genes including Dbp and Cdh6. Up-regulated genes (FDR \u003c 0.1) were associated with the AMP-activated protein kinase signalling pathway (FDR = 0.02) and circadian rhythm (FDR = 0.02), whereas down-regulated DEGs were associated with biosynthesis and metabolic pathways (FDR \u003c 0.05). We identified seven significant clusters of genes (FDR \u003c 0.05, LRT) with similar expression patterns across groups. Functional enrichment analysis of these clusters revealed biological processes that may be implicated in age-related changes in skeletal muscles and/or sarcopenia initiation including extracellular matrix organization and an immune response (FDR \u003c 0.05). Conclusions- Gene expression changes in mouse peripheral nerve were detected prior to disturbances in myofiber innervation and sarcopenia onset. These early molecular changes we report shed a new light on biological processes that may be implicated in sarcopenia initiation and pathogenesis. Future studies are warranted to confirm the disease modifying and/or biomarker potential of the key changes we report here.","tags":["RNA-seq","aging","frailty","motor unit","sarcopenia","skeletal muscle."],"title":"Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of mouse sciatic nerve reveals pathways associated with age-related muscle pathology","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Post-zygotically acquired somatic variants are contributors to a range of neurological disorders. The mosaic brain tissue in individuals harboring these variants allows for the study the cell type involvement and cell type-specific effects of pathogenic variants on transcription. To leverage mosaic brain tissue to understand how somatic variants contribute to disease, we developed Somatic Mosaic single-cell RNAseq (SoMoSeq), for genotyping pathogenic variant loci and sequencing full-length cDNA in single nuclei isolated from human brain tissue. SoMoSeq is a modified version of G\u0026amp;Tseq which uses biotinylated-oligodT-conjugated streptavidin coupled magnetic beads to physically separate DNA and RNA. The resulting DNA is amplified and genotyped with TaqMan assay, while the RNA is utilized to generate full length cDNA using SMARTseq2.We evaluated the efficacy of our approach using mosaic brain tissue samples harboring known pathogenic somatic variants: PIK3CA (E545K, VAF=28%) and SLC35A2 (Y145X, VAF=10%) and three age matched autopsy/stroke controls. After nuclei isolation and fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting with neuronal marker (NeuN), we used SoMoSeq to genotype and generate cDNA from 3072 nuclei. Genotyping analysis accurately reflected the variant allele frequencies (VAF) observed in bulk nuclei in neuronal(NeuN+) and non-neuronal(NeuN-) cells. In parallel, we generated high-quality cDNA from single nuclei (average yield of 1ng/L). From the NeuN+ and NeuN- populations, we selected 96 cells positive/negative for the variants (N=384/sample) and sequenced them at a depth of 8-10M reads/cell. Approximately 10,000 genes/nucleus were detected with an average mitochondrial read percentage of 3%, indicating the high quality of the data. We also observed significant upregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway in the PIK3CA sample compared to controls and evidence of the enrichment of mutations in NeuN- cell types in the mosaic SLC35A2 brain tissue. These findings align with those reported in literature and further validate the accuracy and significance of our method for investigating the effects of pathogenic somatic mutations on cell type-specific transcriptional profiles. Data integration of full length RNAseq with publicly available datasets from human cortex allowing for the classification of specific cell types harboring variant alleles are ongoing. SoMoSeq is a powerful approach that allows for precise identification of specific cell types harboring somatic variants and the ability to study cell type-specific autonomous and non-cell autonomous transcriptional effects of the variant in human brain tissue.\n","date":1674777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674777600,"objectID":"4d8ee465887a1990cf0df96531c9bd5d","permalink":"https://brain-discourse.github.io/project/somoseq/","publishdate":"2023-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/somoseq/","section":"project","summary":"Post-zygotically acquired somatic variants are contributors to a range of neurological disorders.

However, simultaneous assessments of DNA and RNA from single cells required to harness this potential remain technically challenging. Here we describe a novel method that uses parallel single-cell genotyping and comprehensive transcriptomic profiling to study the cellular heterogeneity in mosaic epileptogenic brain tissue.\nMethods: Adapted from the G\u0026amp;Tseq protocol,1 we developed and optimized a method to simultaneously isolate DNA and RNA from single cells to identify the transcriptomic signature in single nuclei with and without the mutation (Figure 1). We benchmarked the protocol by comparing nuclei isolated from surgically resected brain tissue of a patient with hemimegalencephaly harboring a pathogenic somatic variant in PIK3CA (E545K) to an age-matched control sample. A fluorescently-labeled antibody against NeuN was used to isolate neuronal nuclei from the tissue specimens using fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting. Bulk (n=20,000 nuclei/total nuclei) and single nuclei (n=44 NeuN+ nuclei/sample) were collected for the case and control sample. RNA and DNA were isolated from single nuclei and bulk nuclei preparations. RNAseq was performed at a sequencing depth of 15 million (mil) reads/sample for NeuN- and NeuN+ bulk nuclei collections and for the 88 NeuN+ single nuclei from the case and control samples. Genotyping of amplified DNA was used to identify the mutation-positive cells using droplet digital PCR and a custom-designed TaqMan genotyping assay.\nResults: We saw a variant allele fraction of 30% (NeuN+) and 35% (NeuN-) in bulk nuclei collections from the mosaic PIK3CA brain tissue sample, which correlated with that seen in single nuclei. RNA from bulk nuclei populations consistently yielded ~10 mil uniquely mapped reads (UMR). We observed a transcriptomic signature consistent with an upregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway in both NeuN- and NeuN+ bulk nuclei in cases compared to controls. In addition, we found a transcriptomic signature associated with PIK3CA variants specific to NeuN+ nuclei in the CREB phosphorylation pathway.

Pathogenic somatic variants have been identified in many genes within the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-signalling pathway in individuals with hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia (type II), and more recently in SLC35A2 in individuals with focal cortical dysplasia (type I) or non-dysplastic epileptic cortex. Given the expanding role of somatic variants across different brain malformations, we sought to delineate the landscape of somatic variants in a large cohort of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery with hemimegalencephaly or focal cortical dysplasia. We evaluated samples from 123 children with hemimegalencephaly (n = 16), focal cortical dysplasia type I and related phenotypes (n = 48), focal cortical dysplasia type II (n = 44), or focal cortical dysplasia type III (n = 15). We performed high-depth exome sequencing in brain tissue-derived DNA from each case and identified somatic single nucleotide, indel and large copy number variants. In 75% of individuals with hemimegalencephaly and 29% with focal cortical dysplasia type II, we identified pathogenic variants in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway genes. Four of 48 cases with focal cortical dysplasia type I (8%) had a likely pathogenic variant in SLC35A2. While no other gene had multiple disease-causing somatic variants across the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort, four individuals in this group had a single pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variant in CASK, KRAS, NF1 and NIPBL, genes previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. No rare pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variants in any neurological disease genes like those identified in the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort were found in 63 neurologically normal controls (P = 0.017), suggesting a role for these novel variants. We also identified a somatic loss-of-function variant in the known epilepsy gene, PCDH19, present in a small number of alleles in the dysplastic tissue from a female patient with focal cortical dysplasia IIIa with hippocampal sclerosis. In contrast to focal cortical dysplasia type II, neither focal cortical dysplasia type I nor III had somatic variants in genes that converge on a unifying biological pathway, suggesting greater genetic heterogeneity compared to type II. Importantly, we demonstrate that focal cortical dysplasia types I, II and III are associated with somatic gene variants across a broad range of genes, many associated with epilepsy in clinical syndromes caused by germline variants, as well as including some not previously associated with radiographically evident cortical brain malformations.","tags":["Neurodevelopment","Somatic mutations","Epilepsy"],"title":"Somatic variants in diverse genes leads to a spectrum of focal cortical malformations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643241600,"objectID":"e0cc88378211eee4df5dfc8a01f1fc69","permalink":"https://brain-discourse.github.io/project/somatic-variant-analysis/","publishdate":"2022-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/somatic-variant-analysis/","section":"project","summary":"This projects revolves around analyzing somatic, germline and structural variants in focal cortical malformations using whole exome sequencing data.","tags":["Data analysis","Somatic variant calling","Germline variant calling","CNV calling"],"title":"Somatic variants in focal cortical malformations","type":"project"},{"authors":["Meethila Gade","Nicole Comfort","Diane B Re"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"6720526568ae9783f34ceb99a7555c1d","permalink":"https://brain-discourse.github.io/publication/ehs/","publishdate":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ehs/","section":"publication","summary":"The heavy metals lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants and are known to exert severe adverse impacts on the nervous system even at low concentrations. In contrast, the heavy metal manganese (Mn) is first and foremost an essential nutrient, but it becomes neurotoxic at high levels. Neurotoxic metals also include the less prevalent metalloid arsenic (As) which is found in excessive concentrations in drinking water and food sources in many regions of the world. Males and females often differ in how they respond to environmental exposures and adverse effects on their nervous systems are no exception. Here, we review the different types of sex-specific neurotoxic effects, such as cognitive and motor impairments, that have been attributed to Pb, Hg, Mn, Cd, and As exposure throughout the life course in epidemiological as well as in experimental toxicological studies. We also discuss differential vulnerability to these metals such as distinctions in behaviors and occupations across the sexes. Finally, we explore the different mechanisms hypothesized to account for sex-based differential susceptibility including hormonal, genetic, metabolic, anatomical, neurochemical, and epigenetic perturbations. An understanding of the sex-specific effects of environmental heavy metal neurotoxicity can aid in the development of more efficient systematic approaches in risk assessment and better exposure mitigation strategies with regard to sex-linked susceptibilities and vulnerabilities.","tags":["heavy metals","metals","neurotoxic effects","neurotoxicity","sex-specific","sexual dimorphism"],"title":"Sex-specific neurotoxic effects of heavy metal pollutants:Epidemiological, experimental evidence and candidate mechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
