title: The blue pills that became NYC’s worst nightmare
---

In 2017, roughly 64,000 people died from a drug overdose in the United States - the largest
annual increase in drug-related deaths ever recorded by the CDC in history. New York City
lost 1,374 people, with Staten Island being the epicenter of the overdose epidemic where 101
residents succumbed to drug overdoses, mostly involving opioids in 2017
alone. Infamously called painkiller paradise, this borough, a 30-minute ferry ride away from
Manhattan is replete with blue OxyContin pills and adorned with used heroin needles. This
is a public health crisis transcending age, race, and income.  
What started out as a war on drugs during the Nixon era to stigmatize the people of color
became a national epidemic, yet our response has long been rooted in racism and
elitism. With whites being called victims and blacks referred to as addicts, we see a huge
divide based on America’s social hierarchies. It is not as if the addicts have made a choice to
succumb to drugs at the cost of their job, their family or loved ones but are simply the victims
of quasi - coercion due to the addictive nature of the problem. We have little compunction in
saying that the addict's free will is sufficiently impaired, that his apparent consent counts for
naught, emphasizing the need to tackle this problem more like a medical challenge than
criminal justice by embracing compassion and evidence-based interventions,
especially among the marginalized.  

The prevalent definition of addiction–a destructive and compulsive behavioral trait marked
by moral failure needs to be supplanted by the one which describes it as a physical
dependence, something which can be treated as a medical condition. Medication-assisted
treatments (MAT), mostly using Methadone and Suboxone to aid addicts with symptoms of
withdrawal like nausea, body ache, anxiety, excessive sweating, and hallucinations are a need
of the hour. Supplemented with psychotherapy and clean supply of prescription heroin it
can successfully bring down the dependency of people on opioids by addressing behavioral
issues, supporting recovery and preventing relapse. With Methadone and Suboxone being
opioids themselves, this intervention fulfills the opioid craving and stops the cycle; however,
it is not meant to be used as a replacement but to bring drug-use to a safer habit with a
consistent dosage pattern. This strategy is both effective and significantly cheaper than
adding inpatient beds at rehabilitation centers. However, only about one-third of addiction
programs in America offer this treatment, with women, Blacks and Hispanics being less
likely to receive it. 

While the New York City health department has implemented various interventions to
address the medical, psychological and socio-cultural aspects of the epidemic
such as MAT, increased insurance coverage, psychotherapy, good Samaritan laws, and
substance use counseling, they have failed to reach the marginalized sections of the society.
Despite the Healing NYC plan proposed last year to bring down opioid-related deaths to less
than 35%, the epidemic continues to break up families and is one of the leading causes of
higher crime rates and deaths, predominantly in Staten Island and South Bronx, the two
boroughs with many marginalized communities. With overdoses increasing to
112% among black New Yorkers, it is agonizing for people of color to see no commensurate
regard for vulnerable communities who continue to be criminalized and written off, demanding a bipartisan response. It means replacing addiction with physical dependence,
reducing the stigma surrounding the issue and encouraging doctors to provide medication for
addiction in a primary care setting. To make these drugs more accessible to
the marginalized, effort should be made to reduce the high copayments for these drugs and
reach out to communities where issues like these are more prevalent instead of just branding
them as addicts.
  
  These interventions don't seem to be exempt from the argument that some patients will
continue to misuse opioids and spiral down to abuse. However, the model has been
successfully implemented in places like Sydney, Lisbon, and Vancouver, and
has strategically brought down overdose rates. Portugal single-handedly transitioned from the
“heroin capital” of the world to a country with the lowest drug-related death rate in Western
Europe in the past decade by adopting the harm reduction approach. Portugal’s story
reiterates the need for working towards addiction and addiction therapy as a medical
condition, not a moral failure and making maintenance drugs almost as accessible as other
forms of medication. Effort should be made to decriminalize drug use, eliminate the stigma
and reluctance in seeking help, especially among the marginalized. While we can’t
completely eradicate opioids, it is possible to save numerous lives if we treat them as sick
humans who need helping hands, not handcuffs.
