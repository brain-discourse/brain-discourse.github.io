To identify early molecular changes in nerves that may drive sarcopenia initiation, we performed a longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of the sciatic nerve, which governs lower limb muscles, in aging mice. Methods- Sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle were obtained from female C57BL/6JN mice aged 5, 18, 21 and 24 months old (n = 6 per age group). Sciatic nerve RNA was extracted and underwent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Functional enrichment analysis of clusters of genes associated with patterns of gene expression across age groups (adjusted P-value \u003c 0.05, likelihood ratio test [LRT]) was performed. Pathological skeletal muscle aging was confirmed between 21 and 24 months by a combination of molecular and pathological biomarkers. Myofiber denervation was confirmed with qRT-PCR of Chrnd, Chrng, Myog, Runx1 and Gadd45ɑ in gastrocnemius muscle. Changes in muscle mass, cross-sectional myofiber size and percentage of fibres with centralized nuclei were analysed in a separate cohort of mice from the same colony (n = 4-6 per age group).Results- We detected 51 significant DEGs in sciatic nerve of 18-month-old mice compared with 5-month-old mice (absolute value of fold change \u003e 2; false discovery rate [FDR] \u003c 0.05). Up-regulated DEGs included Dbp (log2 fold change [LFC] = 2.63, FDR \u003c 0.001) and Lmod2 (LFC = 7.52, FDR = 0.001). Down-regulated DEGs included Cdh6 (LFC = -21.38, FDR \u003c 0.001) and Gbp1 (LFC = -21.78, FDR \u003c 0.001). We validated RNA-seq findings with qRT-PCR of various up- and down-regulated genes including Dbp and Cdh6. Up-regulated genes (FDR \u003c 0.1) were associated with the AMP-activated protein kinase signalling pathway (FDR = 0.02) and circadian rhythm (FDR = 0.02), whereas down-regulated DEGs were associated with biosynthesis and metabolic pathways (FDR \u003c 0.05). We identified seven significant clusters of genes (FDR \u003c 0.05, LRT) with similar expression patterns across groups. Functional enrichment analysis of these clusters revealed biological processes that may be implicated in age-related changes in skeletal muscles and/or sarcopenia initiation including extracellular matrix organization and an immune response (FDR \u003c 0.05). Conclusions- Gene expression changes in mouse peripheral nerve were detected prior to disturbances in myofiber innervation and sarcopenia onset. These early molecular changes we report shed a new light on biological processes that may be implicated in sarcopenia initiation and pathogenesis. Future studies are warranted to confirm the disease modifying and/or biomarker potential of the key changes we report here.","tags":["RNA-seq","aging","frailty","motor unit","sarcopenia","skeletal muscle."],"title":"Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of mouse sciatic nerve reveals pathways associated with age-related muscle pathology","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Post-zygotically acquired somatic variants are contributors to a range of neurological disorders. The mosaic brain tissue in individuals harboring these variants allows for the study the cell type involvement and cell type-specific effects of pathogenic variants on transcription. To leverage mosaic brain tissue to understand how somatic variants contribute to disease, we developed Somatic Mosaic single-cell RNAseq (SoMoSeq), for genotyping pathogenic variant loci and sequencing full-length cDNA in single nuclei isolated from human brain tissue. SoMoSeq is a modified version of G\u0026amp;Tseq which uses biotinylated-oligodT-conjugated streptavidin coupled magnetic beads to physically separate DNA and RNA. The resulting DNA is amplified and genotyped with TaqMan assay, while the RNA is utilized to generate full length cDNA using SMARTseq2.We evaluated the efficacy of our approach using mosaic brain tissue samples harboring known pathogenic somatic variants: PIK3CA (E545K, VAF=28%) and SLC35A2 (Y145X, VAF=10%) and three age matched autopsy/stroke controls. After nuclei isolation and fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting with neuronal marker (NeuN), we used SoMoSeq to genotype and generate cDNA from 3072 nuclei. Genotyping analysis accurately reflected the variant allele frequencies (VAF) observed in bulk nuclei in neuronal(NeuN+) and non-neuronal(NeuN-) cells. In parallel, we generated high-quality cDNA from single nuclei (average yield of 1ng/L). From the NeuN+ and NeuN- populations, we selected 96 cells positive/negative for the variants (N=384/sample) and sequenced them at a depth of 8-10M reads/cell. Approximately 10,000 genes/nucleus were detected with an average mitochondrial read percentage of 3%, indicating the high quality of the data. We also observed significant upregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway in the PIK3CA sample compared to controls and evidence of the enrichment of mutations in NeuN- cell types in the mosaic SLC35A2 brain tissue. These findings align with those reported in literature and further validate the accuracy and significance of our method for investigating the effects of pathogenic somatic mutations on cell type-specific transcriptional profiles. Data integration of full length RNAseq with publicly available datasets from human cortex allowing for the classification of specific cell types harboring variant alleles are ongoing. SoMoSeq is a powerful approach that allows for precise identification of specific cell types harboring somatic variants and the ability to study cell type-specific autonomous and non-cell autonomous transcriptional effects of the variant in human brain tissue.\n","date":1674777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674777600,"objectID":"4d8ee465887a1990cf0df96531c9bd5d","permalink":"https://brain-discourse.github.io/project/somoseq/","publishdate":"2023-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/somoseq/","section":"project","summary":"Post-zygotically acquired somatic variants are contributors to a range of neurological disorders.

The mosaic brain tissue surgically resected from affected individuals offers a unique opportunity to determine the burden of mutation across cell types, as well as the transcriptional effects of the mutation in specific cell types. However, simultaneous assessments of DNA and RNA from single cells required to harness this potential remain technically challenging. Here we describe a novel method that uses parallel single-cell genotyping and comprehensive transcriptomic profiling to study the cellular heterogeneity in mosaic epileptogenic brain tissue.\nMethods: Adapted from the G\u0026amp;Tseq protocol,1 we developed and optimized a method to simultaneously isolate DNA and RNA from single cells to identify the transcriptomic signature in single nuclei with and without the mutation (Figure 1). We benchmarked the protocol by comparing nuclei isolated from surgically resected brain tissue of a patient with hemimegalencephaly harboring a pathogenic somatic variant in PIK3CA (E545K) to an age-matched control sample. A fluorescently-labeled antibody against NeuN was used to isolate neuronal nuclei from the tissue specimens using fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting. Bulk (n=20,000 nuclei/total nuclei) and single nuclei (n=44 NeuN+ nuclei/sample) were collected for the case and control sample. RNA and DNA were isolated from single nuclei and bulk nuclei preparations. RNAseq was performed at a sequencing depth of 15 million (mil) reads/sample for NeuN- and NeuN+ bulk nuclei collections and for the 88 NeuN+ single nuclei from the case and control samples. Genotyping of amplified DNA was used to identify the mutation-positive cells using droplet digital PCR and a custom-designed TaqMan genotyping assay.\nResults: We saw a variant allele fraction of 30% (NeuN+) and 35% (NeuN-) in bulk nuclei collections from the mosaic PIK3CA brain tissue sample, which correlated with that seen in single nuclei. RNA from bulk nuclei populations consistently yielded ~10 mil uniquely mapped reads (UMR). We observed a transcriptomic signature consistent with an upregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway in both NeuN- and NeuN+ bulk nuclei in cases compared to controls. In addition, we found a transcriptomic signature associated with PIK3CA variants specific to NeuN+ nuclei in the CREB phosphorylation pathway. On average, we obtained ~5 mil UMRs per nuclei (80,000-13 mil, with \u0026gt;50% of cells achieving \u0026gt; than 5 mil UMRs per cell).

Given the expanding role of somatic variants across different brain malformations, we sought to delineate the landscape of somatic variants in a large cohort of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery with hemimegalencephaly or focal cortical dysplasia. We evaluated samples from 123 children with hemimegalencephaly (n = 16), focal cortical dysplasia type I and related phenotypes (n = 48), focal cortical dysplasia type II (n = 44), or focal cortical dysplasia type III (n = 15).

In 75% of individuals with hemimegalencephaly and 29% with focal cortical dysplasia type II, we identified pathogenic variants in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway genes. Four of 48 cases with focal cortical dysplasia type I (8%) had a likely pathogenic variant in SLC35A2.

In contrast, the heavy metal manganese (Mn) is first and foremost an essential nutrient, but it becomes neurotoxic at high levels. Neurotoxic metals also include the less prevalent metalloid arsenic (As) which is found in excessive concentrations in drinking water and food sources in many regions of the world. Males and females often differ in how they respond to environmental exposures and adverse effects on their nervous systems are no exception. Here, we review the different types of sex-specific neurotoxic effects, such as cognitive and motor impairments, that have been attributed to Pb, Hg, Mn, Cd, and As exposure throughout the life course in epidemiological as well as in experimental toxicological studies. We also discuss differential vulnerability to these metals such as distinctions in behaviors and occupations across the sexes. Finally, we explore the different mechanisms hypothesized to account for sex-based differential susceptibility including hormonal, genetic, metabolic, anatomical, neurochemical, and epigenetic perturbations. An understanding of the sex-specific effects of environmental heavy metal neurotoxicity can aid in the development of more efficient systematic approaches in risk assessment and better exposure mitigation strategies with regard to sex-linked susceptibilities and vulnerabilities.","tags":["heavy metals","metals","neurotoxic effects","neurotoxicity","sex-specific","sexual dimorphism"],"title":"Sex-specific neurotoxic effects of heavy metal pollutants:Epidemiological, experimental evidence and candidate mechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

Do we as individuals reserve a right to develop and maintain self-destructive habits? Public health in today’s world is a double-edged sword, stakeholders may not always benefit but others may see a new ray of hope. A review of worker rights within the US illustrates the economic quasi-coercion [1] associated with capitalism while the tobacco industry gives us a glimpse of the omnipresent psychological manipulation people were regularly subjected to. These two issues illustrate the restrictions on an individual’s ability to choose freely and the application of paternalism through public health interventions (OSHA regulations and tobacco tax) to successfully tackle situations when that individual is unable to make an informed decision to avoid harm.\nThe industrialization and urbanization that followed the turn of the 20th century fuelled a precipitous rise in the number of factory jobs [2]. Yet job safety and worker welfare were of little concern in an era when profit was king. Worker safety was the responsibility of the workers themselves, as demonstrated by the Lochner vs New York, 1905 [3] case, which favored the liberty of contract over the health of bakers laboring in unhealthy conditions. Corporations were virtually insulated from liability due to occupational hazards because sustained low-level exposures were easily deniable. They took too long to manifest and not many diseases could be linked to a person’s occupation due to lack of immediate evidence. Silicosis was often mistaken for tuberculosis and only after the Hawk’s Nest Tunnel Disaster[3] was silica exposure recognized as an occupational hazard. Due to the massive press coverage of the incident, factories releasing silica dust, for the first time worked towards reducing exposure levels. There was, however, no legal or regulatory authority to enforce corrective action and assess risk. The environmental movement and the civil rights movement in the 1960s created a climate of reform paving a way for the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970, during the Nixon era [3]. Under this act, employers were responsible for ensuring the safety of their employees and work safety laws were passed and enforced [3].\nAgainst this societal backdrop of gradually increasing attention to safety and health, advertising campaigns of the tobacco industry ensured a steady rise in cigarette consumption through psychological manipulation. Advertisers in the early 1900s bypassed consumers capacity to reason by active manipulation, rendering them confined to choose smartly. Marketing campaigns like “Reach for the Lucky instead of the Sweet” or “Doctors smoke Camels” walked the fine line so characteristic of the consumer culture between demanding conformity and asserting individuality [4]. This drastic rise in cigarette consumption was followed by an attendant rise in the incidence of lung cancers. Increasing interest in the relationship between smoking and lung carcinoma spurred the cigarette industry to launch a massive disinformation campaign by casting doubts on the science. Only after the release of the Surgeon General’s Report- “Smoking and Health” [5] in 1964 did the government decide to ban TV advertising of cigarettes and jumpstart the Non- Smoker’s Rights Movement [5]. The association between both, the industrial accidents and the rise in lung cancer incidents was the lack of causal relationship between exposure and the outcome, laying emphasis on the need for a precautionary approach [6].\nR.E Goodin states, “Harm is of such a nature that it could be avoided by affected if they so choose. The incurring of the harm requires the active cooperation of the victim” [7]. One can say that smokers bring harm to themselves by rationalizing their addiction, anchoring fallacy and time discounting [7] because of voluntary decisions made in the early years influenced by one’s culture, peer pressure, and perpetually rampant manipulation by the media. At the same time, an employee’s decision to take a certain level of risk in exchange for money and job security is his own choice, but is such a decision true consent? R.E. Goodin [7]sheds some light on this topic by stating that smokers are usually not giving their rightful consent when they develop the habit of smoking. He says people can be held to have consented only if they knew to what they were supposedly consenting. This habit is usually picked up during the teenage years when people are minors and, thus, ineligible to give their consent. The addictive nature of nicotine ensures that smoking will soon spiral into addiction. Addiction is the absence of free will [8] and, therefore, taking an addict’s consent would be tantamount to a first order violation. Similarly, a person agreeing to a hazardous job to not stay unemployed is also not giving rightful consent. These examples illustrate the concept of quasi- coercion [1], in which consent …","date":1541116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541116800,"objectID":"ec7e7a7589d45767e5048e6ccf1e61d4","permalink":"https://brain-discourse.github.io/post/ethics/","publishdate":"2018-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ethics/","section":"post","summary":"Is it possible to not have a choice despite being able to make a “choice”?

This is a public health crisis transcending age, race, and income. What started out as a war on drugs during the Nixon era to stigmatize the people of color became a national epidemic, yet our response has long been rooted in racism and elitism. With whites being called victims and blacks referred to as addicts, we see a huge divide based on America’s social hierarchies. It is not as if the addicts have made a choice to succumb to drugs at the cost of their job, their family or loved ones but are simply the victims of quasi - coercion due to the addictive nature of the problem. We have little compunction in saying that the addict’s free will is sufficiently impaired, that his apparent consent counts for naught, emphasizing the need to tackle this problem more like a medical challenge than criminal justice by embracing compassion and evidence-based interventions, especially among the marginalized. The prevalent definition of addiction–a destructive and compulsive behavioral trait marked by moral failure needs to be supplanted by the one which describes it as a physical dependence, something which can be treated as a medical condition. Medication-assisted treatments (MAT), mostly using Methadone and Suboxone to aid addicts with symptoms of withdrawal like nausea, body ache, anxiety, excessive sweating, and hallucinations are a need of the hour. Supplemented with psychotherapy and clean supply of prescription heroin it can successfully bring down the dependency of people on opioids by addressing behavioral issues, supporting recovery and preventing relapse. With Methadone and Suboxone being opioids themselves, this intervention fulfills the opioid craving and stops the cycle; however, it is not meant to be used as a replacement but to bring drug-use to a safer habit with a consistent dosage pattern. This strategy is both effective and significantly cheaper than adding inpatient beds at rehabilitation centers. However, only about one-third of addiction programs in America offer this treatment, with women, Blacks and Hispanics being less likely to receive it. While the New York City health department has implemented various interventions to address the medical, psychological and socio-cultural aspects of the epidemic such as MAT, increased insurance coverage, psychotherapy, good Samaritan laws, and substance use counseling, they have failed to reach the marginalized sections of the society. Despite the Healing NYC plan proposed last year to bring down opioid-related deaths to less than 35%, the epidemic continues to break up families and is one of the leading causes of higher crime rates and deaths, predominantly in Staten Island and South Bronx, the two boroughs with many marginalized communities. With overdoses increasing to 112% among black New Yorkers, it is agonizing for people of color to see no commensurate regard for vulnerable communities who continue to be criminalized and written off, demanding a bipartisan response. It means replacing addiction with physical dependence, reducing the stigma surrounding the issue and encouraging doctors to provide medication for addiction in a primary care setting. To make these drugs more accessible to the marginalized, effort should be made to reduce the high copayments for these drugs and reach out to communities where issues like these are more prevalent instead of just branding them as addicts. These interventions don’t seem to be exempt from the argument that some patients will continue to misuse opioids and spiral down to abuse. However, the model has been successfully implemented in places like Sydney, Lisbon, and Vancouver, and has strategically brought down overdose rates. Portugal single-handedly transitioned from the “heroin capital” of the world to a country with the lowest drug-related death rate in Western Europe in the past decade by adopting the harm reduction approach. Portugal’s story reiterates the need for working towards addiction and addiction therapy as a medical condition, not a moral failure and making maintenance drugs almost as accessible as other forms of medication. Effort should be made to decriminalize drug use, eliminate the stigma and reluctance in seeking help, especially among the marginalized. While we can’t completely eradicate opioids, it is possible to save numerous lives if we treat them as sick humans who need helping hands, not handcuffs.\n","date":1541116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541116800,"objectID":"69df2b6c18933d19a2863a67702f8af9","permalink":"https://brain-discourse.github.io/post/oped/","publishdate":"2018-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/oped/","section":"post","summary":"In 2017, roughly 64,000 people died from a drug overdose in the United States - the largest annual increase in drug-related deaths ever recorded by the CDC in history. New York City lost 1,374 people, with Staten Island being the epicenter of the overdose epidemic where 101 residents succumbed to drug overdoses, mostly involving opioids in 2017 alone.","tags":["Public Health"],"title":"The blue pills that became NYC’s worst nightmare","type":"post"}]
