The mosaic brain tissue surgically resected from affected individuals offers a unique opportunity to determine the burden of mutation across cell types, as well as the transcriptional effects of the mutation in specific cell types. However, simultaneous assessments of DNA and RNA from single cells required to harness this potential remain technically challenging. Here we describe a novel method that uses parallel single-cell genotyping and comprehensive transcriptomic profiling to study the cellular heterogeneity in mosaic epileptogenic brain tissue.\nMethods: Adapted from the G\u0026amp;Tseq protocol,1 we developed and optimized a method to simultaneously isolate DNA and RNA from single cells to identify the transcriptomic signature in single nuclei with and without the mutation (Figure 1). We benchmarked the protocol by comparing nuclei isolated from surgically resected brain tissue of a patient with hemimegalencephaly harboring a pathogenic somatic variant in PIK3CA (E545K) to an age-matched control sample. A fluorescently-labeled antibody against NeuN was used to isolate neuronal nuclei from the tissue specimens using fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting. Bulk (n=20,000 nuclei/total nuclei) and single nuclei (n=44 NeuN+ nuclei/sample) were collected for the case and control sample. RNA and DNA were isolated from single nuclei and bulk nuclei preparations. RNAseq was performed at a sequencing depth of 15 million (mil) reads/sample for NeuN- and NeuN+ bulk nuclei collections and for the 88 NeuN+ single nuclei from the case and control samples. Genotyping of amplified DNA was used to identify the mutation-positive cells using droplet digital PCR and a custom-designed TaqMan genotyping assay.\nResults: We saw a variant allele fraction of 30% (NeuN+) and 35% (NeuN-) in bulk nuclei collections from the mosaic PIK3CA brain tissue sample, which correlated with that seen in single nuclei. RNA from bulk nuclei populations consistently yielded ~10 mil uniquely mapped reads (UMR). We observed a transcriptomic signature consistent with an upregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway in both NeuN- and NeuN+ bulk nuclei in cases compared to controls. In addition, we found a transcriptomic signature associated with PIK3CA variants specific to NeuN+ nuclei in the CREB phosphorylation pathway. On average, we obtained ~5 mil UMRs per nuclei (80,000-13 mil, with \u0026gt;50% of cells achieving \u0026gt; than 5 mil UMRs per cell). Analysis of genotype-informed single nuclei RNAseq is ongoing.\nConclusions: This optimized approach for simultaneous single-cell genotyping and comprehensive cDNA sequencing will be a valuable tool for identifying cell type specific transcriptional profiles associated with recently identified epilepsy-associated mosaic mutations in human brain tissue and may guide us to novel therapeutic targets for treating intractable seizures.\n","date":1669899600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669899600,"objectID":"9afc4f0e87d34b54209b768a9bff30ed","permalink":"https://brain-discourse.github.io/posters/aes-2022/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posters/aes-2022/","section":"Posters","summary":"Abstract: Rationale: Somatic variants acquired post-zygotically during embryonic cortical development are known to contribute to epilepsy-associated cortical brain malformations.

Surgically resected mosaic brain tissue from affected individuals offers a unique opportunity to determine the burden of mutations and transcriptional effects of the mutations across cell types. To tease apart the transcriptional effects of the mutation within cell types, we modified the G\u0026amp;Tseq protocol to simultaneously perform single-cell genotyping and transcriptomic profiling to identify the comprehensive transcriptomic signature of mutation-positive and mutation-negative nuclei. We benchmarked the protocol by comparing nuclei isolated from surgically resected brain tissue of a patient with HMEG harboring a pathogenic somatic variant in PIK3CA (E545K) to an age-matched control.

We also observed transcriptomic signature associated with PIK3CA variants specific to NeuN+ bulk and single nuclei; namely, the CREB phosphorylation pathway and an upregulation of SPDYE5, a gene implicated in low-grade glioma. Analyses of genotype-informed single nuclei RNAseq are currently underway. This approach will allow for novel insights into the impact of pathogenic somatic mutations on cell-autonomous and non-cellautonomous functions, high-resolution assessments of cell-type-specific mutation burden, and may help identify antiseizure targets for treating mTOR related intractable seizures.\n","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669766400,"objectID":"9d8d5308385e624854aa2adce0663426","permalink":"https://brain-discourse.github.io/posters/ashg-2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posters/ashg-2022/","section":"Posters","summary":"Abstract: Post-zygotically acquired mutations that arise during embryonic cortical development can lead to abnormal neuron morphology and/or migration defects, both of which can often result in seizures and developmental disabilities.

Pathogenic somatic variants have been identified in many genes within the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-signalling pathway in individuals with hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia (type II), and more recently in SLC35A2 in individuals with focal cortical dysplasia (type I) or non-dysplastic epileptic cortex. Given the expanding role of somatic variants across different brain malformations, we sought to delineate the landscape of somatic variants in a large cohort of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery with hemimegalencephaly or focal cortical dysplasia. We evaluated samples from 123 children with hemimegalencephaly (n = 16), focal cortical dysplasia type I and related phenotypes (n = 48), focal cortical dysplasia type II (n = 44), or focal cortical dysplasia type III (n = 15). We performed high-depth exome sequencing in brain tissue-derived DNA from each case and identified somatic single nucleotide, indel and large copy number variants. In 75% of individuals with hemimegalencephaly and 29% with focal cortical dysplasia type II, we identified pathogenic variants in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway genes. Four of 48 cases with focal cortical dysplasia type I (8%) had a likely pathogenic variant in SLC35A2. While no other gene had multiple disease-causing somatic variants across the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort, four individuals in this group had a single pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variant in CASK, KRAS, NF1 and NIPBL, genes previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. No rare pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variants in any neurological disease genes like those identified in the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort were found in 63 neurologically normal controls (P = 0.017), suggesting a role for these novel variants. We also identified a somatic loss-of-function variant in the known epilepsy gene, PCDH19, present in a small number of alleles in the dysplastic tissue from a female patient with focal cortical dysplasia IIIa with hippocampal sclerosis. In contrast to focal cortical dysplasia type II, neither focal cortical dysplasia type I nor III had somatic variants in genes that converge on a unifying biological pathway, suggesting greater genetic heterogeneity compared to type II. Importantly, we demonstrate that focal cortical dysplasia types I, II and III are associated with somatic gene variants across a broad range of genes, many associated with epilepsy in clinical syndromes caused by germline variants, as well as including some not previously associated with radiographically evident cortical brain malformations.","tags":["Neurodevelopment","Somatic mutations","Epilepsy"],"title":"Somatic variants in diverse genes leads to a spectrum of focal cortical malformations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meethila Gade","Nicole Comfort","Diane B Re"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"6720526568ae9783f34ceb99a7555c1d","permalink":"https://brain-discourse.github.io/publication/ehs/","publishdate":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ehs/","section":"publication","summary":"The heavy metals lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants and are known to exert severe adverse impacts on the nervous system even at low concentrations. In contrast, the heavy metal manganese (Mn) is first and foremost an essential nutrient, but it becomes neurotoxic at high levels. Neurotoxic metals also include the less prevalent metalloid arsenic (As) which is found in excessive concentrations in drinking water and food sources in many regions of the world. Males and females often differ in how they respond to environmental exposures and adverse effects on their nervous systems are no exception. Here, we review the different types of sex-specific neurotoxic effects, such as cognitive and motor impairments, that have been attributed to Pb, Hg, Mn, Cd, and As exposure throughout the life course in epidemiological as well as in experimental toxicological studies. We also discuss differential vulnerability to these metals such as distinctions in behaviors and occupations across the sexes. Finally, we explore the different mechanisms hypothesized to account for sex-based differential susceptibility including hormonal, genetic, metabolic, anatomical, neurochemical, and epigenetic perturbations. An understanding of the sex-specific effects of environmental heavy metal neurotoxicity can aid in the development of more efficient systematic approaches in risk assessment and better exposure mitigation strategies with regard to sex-linked susceptibilities and vulnerabilities.","tags":["heavy metals","metals","neurotoxic effects","neurotoxicity","sex-specific","sexual dimorphism"],"title":"Sex-specific neurotoxic effects of heavy metal pollutants:Epidemiological, experimental evidence and candidate mechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meethila Gade","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
