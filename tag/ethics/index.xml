Do we as individuals reserve a right to develop and maintain self-destructive habits? Public health in today’s world is a double-edged sword, stakeholders may not always benefit but others may see a new ray of hope. A review of worker rights within the US illustrates the economic quasi-coercion [1] associated with capitalism while the tobacco industry gives us a glimpse of the omnipresent psychological manipulation people were regularly subjected to. These two issues illustrate the restrictions on an individual’s ability to choose freely and the application of paternalism through public health interventions (OSHA regulations and tobacco tax) to successfully tackle situations when that individual is unable to make an informed decision to avoid harm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The industrialization and urbanization that followed the turn of the 20th century fuelled a precipitous rise in the number of factory jobs [2]. Yet job safety and worker welfare were of little concern in an era when profit was king. Worker safety was the responsibility of the workers themselves, as demonstrated by the Lochner vs New York, 1905 [3] case, which favored the liberty of contract over the health of bakers laboring in unhealthy conditions. Corporations were virtually insulated from liability due to occupational hazards because sustained low-level exposures were easily deniable. They took too long to manifest and not many diseases could be linked to a person’s occupation due to lack of immediate evidence. Silicosis was often mistaken for tuberculosis and only after the Hawk’s Nest Tunnel Disaster[3] was silica exposure recognized as an occupational hazard. Due to the massive press coverage of the incident, factories releasing silica dust, for the first time worked towards reducing exposure levels. There was, however, no legal or regulatory authority to enforce corrective action and assess risk. The environmental movement and the civil rights movement in the 1960s created a climate of reform paving a way for the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970, during the Nixon era [3]. Under this act, employers were responsible for ensuring the safety of their employees and work safety laws were passed and enforced [3].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Against this societal backdrop of gradually increasing attention to safety and health, advertising campaigns of the tobacco industry ensured a steady rise in cigarette consumption through psychological manipulation. Advertisers in the early 1900s bypassed consumers capacity to reason by active manipulation, rendering them confined to choose smartly. Marketing campaigns like “Reach for the Lucky instead of the Sweet” or “Doctors smoke Camels” walked the fine line so characteristic of the consumer culture between demanding conformity and asserting individuality [4]. This drastic rise in cigarette consumption was followed by an attendant rise in the incidence of lung cancers. Increasing interest in the relationship between smoking and lung carcinoma spurred the cigarette industry to launch a massive disinformation campaign by casting doubts on the science. Only after the release of the Surgeon General’s Report- “Smoking and Health” [5] in 1964 did the government decide to ban TV advertising of cigarettes and jumpstart the Non- Smoker’s Rights Movement [5]. The association between both, the industrial accidents and the rise in lung cancer incidents was the lack of causal relationship between exposure and the outcome, laying emphasis on the need for a precautionary approach [6].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R.E Goodin states, “Harm is of such a nature that it could be avoided by affected if they so choose. The incurring of the harm requires the active cooperation of the victim” [7]. One can say that smokers bring harm to themselves by rationalizing their addiction, anchoring fallacy and time discounting [7] because of voluntary decisions made in the early years influenced by one’s culture, peer pressure, and perpetually rampant manipulation by the media. At the same time, an employee’s decision to take a certain level of risk in exchange for money and job security is his own choice, but is such a decision true consent? R.E. Goodin [7]sheds some light on this topic by stating that smokers are usually not giving their rightful consent when they develop the habit of smoking. He says people can be held to have consented only if they knew to what they were supposedly consenting. This habit is usually picked up during the teenage years when people are minors and, thus, ineligible to give their consent. The addictive nature of nicotine ensures that smoking will soon spiral into addiction. Addiction is the absence of free will [8] and, therefore, taking an addict’s consent would be tantamount to a first order violation. Similarly, a person agreeing to a hazardous job to not stay unemployed is also not giving rightful consent. These examples illustrate the concept of quasi- coercion [1], in which consent dictated by unfair restriction of alternatives is an indirect, pervasive erosion of choice. The quasi-coercive nature of smoking and unsafe employment are fundamentally due to social institutions. In this unfair market, the inequality between certain sections of the society grows over time, leaving them with no bargaining power, making risk taking a mandatory job requirement. Quasi- coercion, thus, creates only an illusion of autonomy [1].
Differential risk of disease in different socioeconomic classes is also evident. The impact of widespread anti-smoking campaigns is clear among the educated and wealthy. However, the people with lower socioeconomic status due to lack awareness on health concerns of cigarettes and occupational stress, resort to smoking as a coping mechanism. As a result, they become victims of the regressive cigarette tax and denormalization of smoking and are subject to increasing marginalization and stigmatization. This demographic is also more susceptible to economic quasi-coercion. Daniel M Gade [9] very effectively highlights this issue by asking what would happen if every individual had a chance to start equal? Inequalities in health status are not solely the consequences of inequality in health services, but also a result of lifestyle choices one makes due to inequity. This emphasizes the need for equitable redistribution of social goods since having equality in health care does not compensate us for the unequal risks of getting ill. Guaranteeing equal opportunity necessitates the elimination of differential risk, the prevention of excess illness, and the alteration of fundamental institutional arrangements [1].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ensuring equal opportunity would require the elimination of harmful choices. Does the government have the right of stopping people who want to live and act in a way they falsely believe to be safe? Is it the responsibility of public health workers to ensure that consent to smoke or take up risk is rightfully taken and by no means coerced on an individual? The ultimate justification for paternalism must be utilitarian, ensuring that overall social utility is maximized when utilities of all members of the society are maximized [7]. Decisions regarded as self-destructive and unhealthy are not conclusive grounds for interventions. Only if these decisions are a result of independently defined failures of competency such as addiction or low socio-economic status is paternalistic intervention justified. Yet unhealthy lifestyles impose a substantial burden on an uninvolved portion of society that, nevertheless, must share the costs of illnesses created by said choices. In response to this, we follow John Stuart Mills’s Harm principle [10] and work our way towards Neoprohibitionism [8] by changing norms (ban on smoking in public places) and making each pack of cigarettes reflect the price of the negative externalities (cigarette tax).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In argument, one may bring up the issue of autonomy and individual liberty of smokers and workers, which conflicts with public health interventions. There exists a conflict between liberty and equality, such that unduly paternalistic and stringent regulations prize workers’ health more highly than the workers themselves[1]. Several professions such as that of a soldier, stuntman, and firefighter involve risks, yet are regularly portrayed as heroic; why should exposure risk be classified differently. Doesn’t this overreaching by the meddlesome nanny state agency (OSHA) violate the concept of autonomy? A smoker’s opinion is lost in the tyranny of the majority. The rights of the individual are subsumed within the social contract [7] which permits government intervention in situations in which individual competence to make rational decisions is temporarily or permanently undermined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the lessons of history, while, it may take a tragedy to realize the importance of safety and health regulations, one can successfully counter such issues with appropriate measures and support from the industry and the government in the form of OSHA compliance and introduction of cigarette taxes. A paternalistic approach may seem slightly overbearing, but it is necessary to ensure social equity and protect the vulnerable from exploitation. Although autonomy or personal freedom is central to human rights [11], this autonomy can at times be illusionary with regard to “valid consent”. Successful public health interventions in the field of occupational health and tobacco industry demonstrate that “harm” despite being instilled upon oneself as a “choice” is nothing but an illusion of autonomy, differentially distributed in our society. It is, therefore, the duty of public health professionals to ameliorate injustice and establish trust in people by providing them with adequate information, thereby, allowing them to make informed decisions. After all, an intervention is only effective when there is a significant amount of public trust involved in adapting it.&lt;/p>
